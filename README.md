Processing Tutorial
===================

[Processing](http://processing.org/) is a [Domain-Specific Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_specific_language) (DSL) for visualization built on top of the [Java programming-language](http://java.oracle.com/). That means that if you already know Java, or another C-like language, then you already know how to use the most basic functionality of Processing.

The Processing Environment
==========================

You can use any text-editor to write a Processing program, but the recommended way to write a Processing language is using the Sketchbook environment:
